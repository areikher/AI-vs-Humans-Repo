# AI-vs-Humans-Repo

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and dataset used for my AI vs. Human content classification analysis.

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes 1,367 writing samples from eight different mediums. It is evenly balanced, with 50% authored by humans and 50% generated by AI.

The goal of this project is to determine which classification model achieves the highest accuracy in distinguishing between human- and AI-generated text.
